      | teacher  |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |

    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    And I press "Create a new question ..."
    And I set the field "Embedded answers with REGEXP (Clozergx)" to "1"
    And I click on "Add" "button" in the "Choose a question type to add" "dialogue"

    And I press "id_analyzequestion"
    Then I should see "Answer 1 must be a correct answer (grade = 100%) and it will not be analysed as a regular expression."
    Then I should see "One of the answers should have a score of 100% so it is possible to get full marks for this question."
    And I set the field "Question text" to "The French flag is {1:REGEXP:%100%blue, white and red#Congratulations! ~%100%((white, blue and red|red, white and blue)}."
    And I press "id_analyzequestion"
    Then I should see "ERROR! Check your parentheses or square brackets!"
